        <p>
            This Course Management System allows users to create and manage courses, sections, rooms, and room requests. 
            To get started, create an account or log in if you already have one. Once logged in, you can create new courses via the "Create Course" page. 
            After creating a course, add sections by providing details such as section code and professor name. 
            You can also create rooms by specifying the building and room number.
            <br><br>
            To schedule a Class Meeting for a specific time slot, submit a room request, which will be processed based on availability. 
            Use the navigation links to explore different functionalities and manage your courses and rooms effectively.
